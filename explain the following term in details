1. various source of bigdata are enterprise data,public data,transactional data,social media,sensor data,historical data,geographical data
banking related data etc.


2.3 V's of big data are Volume-it is the amount of data which may be in terabytes or petabytes.
                        Variety-it is the type of data which may be structured or unstructured or semi structured
                         Velocity-it is the speed at which data is added it may be real time,batch etc.
                         
                         
                         
3.Horizontal scaling and vertical Scaling-
                           Horizontal Scaling-In this type of scaling CPU power and storage space is increased in a single machine.
                           Vertical Scaling- in this type of approach data is divided and distributed to multiple server or machines.
                           
                           
                           
4. Need and Working of Hadoop-
                             Hadoop is an open source platform which provide excellent data management provision.
                             it is designed to expand from single server to thousand of machines,
                             each providing computation and storage.
